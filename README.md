# TrackGPT: Track What You Need in Videos via Text Prompts

Inspired by [Track-Anything](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything), TrackGPT allows users to detect and track objects in videos using text prompts. It is developed uponÂ [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), [DetGPT](https://github.com/OptimalScale/DetGPT), [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and [XMem](https://github.com/hkchengrex/XMem). By leveraging the capabilities of DetGPT, TrackGPT is able to interpret user instructions in natural language to segment objects of interest in video frames. Users input a text instruction, and TrackGPT intelligently finds and tracks the specified object throughout the video.
